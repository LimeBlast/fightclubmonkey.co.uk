      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    </header>
    <blockquote>Fight Club Monkey is a gaming clan that focuses more on having fun than winning the game.</blockquote>
    <p>Although we call ourselves a clan, we are more of a gaming social club, a group of friends that play games
      together.</p>

    <h3>What do you mean by gaming social club?</h3>

    <p>We feel that term describes us better than the word clan because of the activities we engage in. While most other
      clans exist purely for the game they play, we exist so that we can meet new people and enjoy ourselves while
      interacting with each another. While some of this interaction is within a game environment, it extends much
      further than this to include instant messaging, voice communications and chats in our Facebook group.</p>

    <p>This extends to when we are playing as well. Even when playing competitive games, we mind so much about winning
      or loosing (although winning is a great, but rare, treat), but rather about having a good time while we do it. We
      encourage people to chat while they play, ether using the game’s text chat support features, or using voice
      communications software (such as our TeamSpeak server). We often don’t like it when people stay silent.</p>

    <h3>Ethics</h3>

    <p>We have three main ethics that we use as a basis for our clan. Each of which is represented by one of the three
      triangles of the triforce on our shield:</p>
    <ul class="default">
      <li>Respect for yourself and others.</li>
      <li>Friendship within the group and beyond.</li>
      <li>Enjoyment (it’s the reason we play the game in the first place).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We expect all our members to understand and respect our ethics, and to follow them at all times.</p>

      <h2>Our History</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Back in early 2002, a friend (Nichol) and I (Daniel) were keen multiplayer gaming fans, we had just got broadband
      connections and were eager to find out what online gaming was like. After a while we found a decent game to play
      (Urban Terror, a mod for Quake 3 Arena) and started to learn it… while we were never great players, we could aim a
      gun and shoot people without problem, so we decided to take the next step and join a clan.</p>

    <p>We both joined different clans to see what they were like, the plan was for one of us to leave the worse of the
      two clans and join the better one of the two. I don’t know if this was just bad luck, or maybe fate, but both of
      the clans we joined were terrible.</p>

    <p>In one of the clans, the leaders were all about becoming uber-pro players, and winning – whatever the cost. If
      you missed a kill, rather than a “never mind, you’ll do better next time” message, all you would get was an
      insult, and an order to do better. The other clan was just as bad with lots of people cheating and generally being
      very nasty and difficult, both to the teams they played against, as well as each other.</p>

    <p>We decided that enough was enough, and together planed to form our own clan, a clan that would be different to
      the rest, a clan that would do things right, a clan that would follow our ethics and ensure that everyone had a
      good time while playing.</p>

    <h3>Where did the name come from?</h3>

    <p>The name
      <em>Fight Club Monkey</em> came from a brainstorming session between Nichol and I. Although I can't remember any
      of the other names we came up with, I do know the final choice was inspired both by the film Fight Club, and the
      <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyoGDAjd0eA">ITV digital adverts featuring Johnny Vegas and his
        pet/sidekick monkey &#8211; Monkeh</a>.

      <h2>Past Games</h2>
    </header>
    <h3>Fight Club Monkey – The First Person Shooters</h3>

    <p>Under the guise of
      <em>Fight Cub Monkey</em>, the clan has played a number of different FPS games over the years, including:</p>
    <ul class="default">
      <li>Urban Terror</li>
      <li>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</li>
      <li>Soldier of Fortune</li>
      <li>Battlefield 1942</li>
      <li>Unreal Tournament 2003/4</li>
      <li>Team Fortress 2</li>
      <li>Battlefield Bad Company 2</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Fellowship of the Monkey</em> – Neocron</h3>

    <p>Our Neocron (NC) guild was called <em>Fellowship of the Monkey</em> (FotM) and belonged to the
      <em>Fallen Angels</em> faction, primarily based within
      <em>Tech Haven</em>. We remained fairly small, generally only inviting our friends into the guild. Eventually,
      once the game became boring (it was plagued with bugs and problems) most of the members quit the game, and
      everyone that was left was absorbed into
      <em>The Shattered Star Confederation</em> (SSC).</p>

    <h3><em>The Army of the 12 Monkeys</em> – Dark Age of Camelot</h3>

    <p>Our Dark Age of Camelot (DAoC) guild was called <em>The Army of the 12 Monkeys</em> (A12M), and was based within
      the realm of Midgard. Although our main base of operations was within <em>FortAtla</em> (and the nearby island
      nicked named <em>MonkeyIsland</em>), we would explore the entire realm on our travels.. even enter other realms to
      do battle, and protect our own realm from invasion.</p>

    <p>A12M was much larger than FotM, with us inviting both friends, and people we met within the game, to join the
      guild. It was also far more organised than FotM, and we often planned player events, and ensured that we always
      supported our crafters with money and items. We eventually stopped playing the game due to other commitments, so
      invited our members to join one of the guilds within the alliance we started. We’re still good friends with a lot
      of the people we met via DAoC.</p>

    <h3><em>The League of Extraordinary Monkeys</em> – World of WarCraft</h3>

    <p>Several long-term members of FcM were participants in the World of Warcraft (WoW) beta, and when the game went
      live in 2005 they quickly established a new guild on the Arathor server. Named
      <em>The League of Extraordinary Monkeys</em>, the guild sought to follow the ideals we’d worked so hard on in
      DAoC.</p>

    <p>With no official social hang-out for the Arathor server on the official forums, The League took matters into
      their own hands. Daniel registered an Arathor domain name and cultivated a forum which became so popular
      among the server populace that it’s hosting had to be upgraded several times.</p>

    <p>The guild remained active as far as The Burning Crusade expansion, before other commitments and newer games
      resulted in our dispersal. Those of us who remember, have extremely fond memories of our time in WoW, but
      generally agree that it’s time has passed.</p>

    <h3><em>Fullmetal Monkey</em> – Diablo III</h3>

    <p>Diablo III (D3) was the latest point and click RPG from Blizzard. D3 supports up to 4 players in a cooperative
      environment as they battle through a world populated by zombies, monsters and demons, with the sole aim of
      defeating Diablo himself (in addition to collecting some ‘phat loot’).</p>

    <p>Although D3 doesn’t support an in-game guild system, we wanted to stick with our tradition of giving our RPG
      games a new name, so decided upon <strong>Fullmetal Monkey</strong> (<em><strong>FM</strong>)</em>, inspired by
      the manga and anime <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>.</p>

      <h2>Currently Playing</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Unlike traditional gaming guilds and clans, which focus on a single game, and aim to be the best at it with
      military planning and precision, we’re a far more relaxed outfit, which believe in gaming for fun. As a result of
      this, we’ll often have a couple of different ‘official’ games going at a time.</p>

    <h3><em>Monkeys and Demons</em> – Guild Wars 2</h3>

    <p>Guild Wars 2 (GW2) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game in development by ArenaNet. Set in the
      fantasy world of Tyria, the game follows the re-emergence of Destiny’s Edge, a disbanded guild dedicated to
      fighting the Elder Dragons, a Lovecraftian species that has seized control of Tyria in the time since the original
      Guild Wars.</p>

    <p>As a guild, the majority of our players play on the <strong>Vabbi</strong> EU server, on which we’re hoping to
      strike up a presence, although players on other servers can still join. We don’t actively recruit new
      members, but we’re always willing to entertain applications. The guild name <strong>Monkeys and Demons</strong>
      (<em><strong>[MaD]</strong>)</em> was inspired by the book and film <em>Angels and Demons</em> by Dan Brown.</p>

    <h3><em>Mineclub Monkey</em> - Minecraft</h3>

    <p>Minecraft (MC) is the indie game that was a huge success before it even got an official released. Created by
      Markus Persson (aka, Notch), MC is focused on creativity and building, allowing players to build constructions out
      of textured cubes in a 3D world by acquire resources while maintaining their health and hunger, and fending off
      attacks from Creepers and other night-time nasties.</p>

    <p>As a clan we run our own Minecraft server. In world, we have a communal hub called <em>Monkey Island</em>, which
      we use as a central location for players to share resources, helping create the healthy community spirit that we
      like.</p>
